I'm Zoe (she/her), a PhD candidate in the Riginos Lab at the University of Queensland. My work combines genomic tools with ecological and environmental data as well as long-term experiments to learn more about the evolutionary history and adaptive potential of corals from the Great Barrier Reef. Some of my research interests include marine speciation and hybridization, population connectivity and dispersal, and the distribution of adaptive genetic variation across environments. I am particularly interested in using fundamental knowledge from population genomics to better predict the fate of coral species and populations under climate change and to help conservation and restoration efforts.

I am very lucky to have grown up in the French Caribbeans, surrounded by nature, where I first discovered and fell in love marine ecosystems. I was privileged to have a supportive family that prioritized my education, and I am passionate about increasing access to academia and diversity in science.
