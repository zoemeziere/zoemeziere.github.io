## Cryptic speciation in *Stylophora pistillata*

::: {.column width="44%"}
For the first PhD chapter, I extensively sampled *Stylophora pistillata* colonies across diverse habitats and at multiple reefs of the Great Barrier Reef. With a final dataset of 379 individuals and 5,332 SNPs obtained from reduced representation (ddRAD) sequencing, I discovered five distinct taxa, with wide geographic ranges and extensive sympatry. I used demographic modelling to investigate divergence histories and found that speciation events have occurred with ongoing or episodic gene flow and that these taxa are at different stages along a divergence continuum. In addition, significant correlations between genetic divergence and environmental variables suggest that niche partitioning may have played a role in speciation and that *S. pistillata* taxa might be differentially adapted to their environment.
