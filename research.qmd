## Cryptic speciation in *Stylophora pistillata*

::: {.column .add-space width="65%"}
For the first PhD chapter, I extensively sampled *Stylophora pistillata* colonies across diverse habitats and at multiple reefs of the Great Barrier Reef. With a final dataset of 379 individuals and 5,332 SNPs obtained from reduced representation (ddRAD) sequencing, I discovered five distinct taxa, with wide geographic ranges and extensive sympatry. I used demographic modelling to investigate divergence histories and found that speciation events have occurred with ongoing or episodic gene flow and that these taxa are at different stages along a divergence continuum. In addition, significant correlations between genetic divergence and environmental variables suggest that niche partitioning may have played a role in speciation and that *S. pistillata* taxa might be differentially adapted to their environment.

## Dispersal, gene flow and genetic diversity in co-distributed coral species

::: {.column .add-space width="65%"}
For my second PhD chapter, I investigated how coral reproductive modes (i.e., brooding vs spawning) and associated early life-history traits (e.g., pelagic larval duration) affect the spatial scale of dispersal and resulting ecological and evolutionary processes. I examined two closely related coral species, *Stylophora pistillata* (brooding) and *Pocillopora verrucosa* (spawning) and sampled individuals separated by a range of geographic distances ranging from meters to 2,200 km on the Great Barrier Reef. I found that reproductive mode predicts dispersal variance, with meter-scale dispersal in *S. pistillata* and kilometre-scale dispersal in the spawning *P. verrucosa*. These differences in dispersal potential are important, not only for shaping ecological dynamics, but also historical levels of gene flow and the distribution of genetic diversity within populations.

## Long-term coral common garden experiment during a natural bleaching event

::: {.column .add-space width="65%"}
During the summer of 2024, the Great Barrier Reef was hit by a fifth mass bleaching event, which particular affected the Southern reefs. To capture intra-specific variation in phenotypic responses facing heat stress and to relate these phenotypic differences with genomic variation, I conducted a long-term common garden experiment. Specifically, I subjected fragments of multiple *S. pistillata* genotypes to a common environment that was representative of natural conditions during and after a heat wave. By combining weekly survival and health measurements with whole-genome sequencing data, I aim to uncover the genomic basis of bleaching and survival variation within species at small spatial scale. Stay tune!
