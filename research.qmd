For my PhD research, I am combining genomic tools, ecological and environmental data as well as long-term experiments to learn about the evolution and ecology of coral species and to better understand their fate under climate change. Some of the main themes of my research are summarized bellow.

## Cryptic speciation in *Stylophora pistillata*

## Dispersal, gene flow and genetic diversity in *Stylophora pistillata* and *Pocillopora verrucosa*

## Long-term coral common garden experiment
